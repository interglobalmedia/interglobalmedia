    background:
        "Years ago, when I was in graphic design, I was always in awe of and impressed by the young IT guy that would come in and set me up for various things on my Power Mac G4 while he typed commands in my computer's Terminal window. I would repeatedly say \"I want to learn how to use the Terminal program. It's so cool and powerful!\" Then some years later I started learning web development and was afforded the opportunity to learn how to use the Command Line. I haven't looked back since. I've had my share of using GUIs, and admittedly in some cases, like working with databases in backend development, a combination of GUI and Terminal works best for me. But I will always remain faithful to my CLI. It is extremely important to know in Full Stack Javascript, for example. It makes for more agile development in my opinion. Yes, there is a steeper learning curve than with GUIs, but as the saying goes, \"Anything that's worth it is never easy!\" So don't let anyone discourage you from learning Command Line because \"it's so difficult to learn\", if that is what you want to do. You will gain a much better understanding and control of your computer if you opt for that route!",
