    shortDescription: `A fun little game made with JavaScript, SCSS/CSS3, and HTML. As I was developing this game, it also reminded me of the importance of checking for browser compatibility. Not knowing how your application works on various browsers, rather all the most important ones (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE), can result in major feature breakers! I wrote about my cross browser compatibility experience while developing this game on my Developer Blog. The post is entitled e.keyCode || e.which?. You can find the link to the post on the Guess the Keys Github repository README.md.`,
