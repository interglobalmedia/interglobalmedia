    shortDescription: `A little text to speech app I created so that cat lovers could be inspired to write about their cats using the Speech Synthesis API while being inspired by the app’s cat image slideshow. There is also music if one wants to listen while writing. The user’s text is saved to session storage. If the user reaches the 5mb limit, he/she can save it to a .txt file and download it.`,
