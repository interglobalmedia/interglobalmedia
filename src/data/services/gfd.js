        "When I decided to switch careers and become a developer, I found that most teaching, tutorials, courses, etc., only made cursory introductions to Git, and then went on to focus on code creation only. Git seemed to be an afterthought to them, even though it is an expected skill on the job. I found that to be a flawed approach. I taught myself Git along with learning how to code so that I could apply best practices from the get go. At first it was really hard, because I was learning on my own, and there wasn't too much beyond the basics to glean from. Things haven't changed too much since then. Developers keep on mostly rehashing the basics, but if one persists in getting to know Git, it becomes easier to find the right resources. That is what happened with me. The other thing that is very important in the acquisition of Git skills is working with others. Using Git by oneself is very different than using it in a team environment. Inter-Global Media Network, Inc. provides the opportunity to those that don't have access to teams to learn and use Git with other(s) in a structured environment.",
