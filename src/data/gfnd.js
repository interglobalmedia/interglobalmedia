        'Working in non-developer related environments after I had learned Git made me realize that Git is not just for developers (anymore). Most everyone has to manage myriad files and directories and probably a myriad of versions. What better way to take control of them than with Git version control? Invented by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux Kernel and originally meant for developers to track changes in source code during software development, even the Wikipedia page for Git states that "It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files." AND, "Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows."',

        "I believe in working collaboratively and closely with my clients. Inter-Global Media Network inc.'s mission is to design, develop, and teach experiences that make people's lives simpler. Not only do my services entail building applications for clients but also providing them with a better understanding of the tools they depend on or want to learn.",
