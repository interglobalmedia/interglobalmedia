Recently I updated to the current latest version of GatsbyJS - 2.18.16 from 2.10.0. When I tried to deploy new content to my site, I got the following error:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'gatsby/dist/utils/create-content-digest'
```

I had no idea what this meant.  As a result, I decided to run

```
npx gatsby build
```

locally to see what would happen there. I usually do that, but things were going so swimmingly and I was not adding anything except content, so I thought it would not be necessary to run a build locally to check if everything was working properly. Boy was I wrong!

When I ran

```
npx gatsby build
```

in Terminal, I got the following:

```
npx gatsby build                                                       ⏎
The above error occurred in the <StoreStateProvider> component:
    in StoreStateProvider
    in App

React will try to recreate this component tree from scratch using the error boundary you provided, App.
Warning: App: Error boundaries should implement getDerivedStateFromError(). In that method, return a state update to display an error message or fallback UI.
```

"What is going on here?", I asked myself. I never got this before! Of course I had not been running on Node.js 12.14.0 or using GatsbyJS 2.18.16, so anything was possible!

I googled this issue and found the following solution (which worked). The first part which explained the issue:

```
I hit this issue. It's because there's two versions of react installed. Run an npm ls react to see them. I have a version of react specified in my package.json, and looks like gatsby/gatsby-cli 2.18.5 has a different version of react.
I learned of the issue through this page.
Still trying to fix the issue…
```

And the second part which revealed the working solution:

```
I fixed the problem! I used npm to uninstall, then (re)install react, react-dom, and gatsby. I did it in that exact order (I don't believe ordering would matter, but FYI in case it does).
npm ls react shows two versions, but they're the same and marked as "deduped":
npm ls react
interglobalmedia@0.0.1 /Users/mariacam/Development/interglobalmedia
├─┬ gatsby@2.18.16
│ └─┬ gatsby-cli@2.8.21
│   └── react@16.12.0 
├─┬ netlify-cms-app@2.9.5
│ └─┬ netlify-cms-core@2.12.1
│   └── react@16.8.6  deduped
└── react@16.8.6
```

I replaced the Github user's output from his `npm ls react` and replaced it with my own. 

The reason for deduping occurring is because `Gatsby` had its own version of `react`, 16.12.0, and I have my own, 16.8.6, as well as `react-dom` 16.8.6. Can't believe that for once I was actually behind in a version lol.

Just as matthewlwang (Github user), I removed the gatsby, react, and react-dom with

```
npm uninstall gatsby react react-dom -S
```

and then re-installed gatsby, and installed react@16.12.0 and react-dom@16.12.0. I still encountered the same error:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'gatsby/dist/utils/create-content-digest'

```

I checked to see what was the latest version of the gatsby-plugin-manifest. After finding it on npmjs.com, I found that I did NOT have the latest version. Mine was 2.1.1, and the current latest version is 2.2.34. So I updated to that version.

Then I ran

```
npx gatsby build
```

again. This time it was a success. I needed to have the latest version of the gatsby-plugin-manifest plugin! This is what was returned in Terminal:

```
npx gatsby build                                                                                ✹

Now to try and deploy to Netlify again! But guess what? It did not succeed on remote build on Netlify. Why?

There were to calls to sharp locally. One was in the path

```
/Users/mariacam/Development/interglobalmedia/node_modules/sharp/vendor/lib/libgio-2.0.0.dylib
```

and the other in the path

```
/Users/mariacam/Development/interglobalmedia/node_modules/gatsby-plugin-manifest/node_modules/sharp/vendor/lib/libgio-2.0.0.dylib
```

which was located within the newly updated `gatsby-plugin-manifest` plugin. The reason why, however, build was successful locally, is because OSX does not care if there are two installs of the same thing. It will simply choose one to implement.

```
npx gatsby build
success open and validate gatsby-configs - 0.097s

```

When I googled this issue of duplicate files, I found the following on Github:

```
The Mac filesystem can't tell the difference, so it just saves one of the files.

The Netlify builds run in a linux environment which can tell the difference between the two files, so both files exist after Netlify clones your git repo. 
```

This results in a conflict which results in a failed build.


So what did I do? I knew that the sharp file I needed resided in gatsby-plugin-manifest, so I removed the following from node_modules:

```
/Users/mariacam/Development/interglobalmedia/node_modules/sharp/vendor/lib/libgio-2.0.0.dylib
```

When I ran the build again, I got the following:

```
npx gatsby build                                                                                ✹
success open and validate gatsby-configs - 0.087s                                                        ⠋ load plugins

One of the two will be used. success load plugins - 5.956s
```

Since

```
/usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.58.2/lib/libgio-2.0.0.dylib
```

Only resided locally, I knew there would be no potential for file duplication, and that the remote build on Netlify should succeed. And it did. I got the following back:

When using tools from various sources, there is always a potential for some sort of incompatibility or conflict. One just has to fix the issue(s) one step at a time!

UPDATE: Apparently there was also an `Xcode` issue resulting from ***upgrading*** to OSX Catalina` which screwed up **Terminal** behavior, but I also had to remove the `gatsby-plugin-manifest` and the `gatsby-plugin-offline` in order to deploy to remote successfully. But it didn't stop there.`

When I ran

```
npx gatsby build
```

again, I got the following in the Netlify Console during the build process:

```

The heap out of memory issue resulting in a failed build was due to the version of `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms` I was using. `4.1.1`. I found out that I had to ***update*** to version `4.1.2` or later.

I finally achieved success ***deploying*** to **Netlify**, but at the cost of ***removing*** `gatsby-plugin-manifest` (and `gatsby-plugin-offline`). I hope the manifest ***dedupe*** issue regarding the `sharp dependency` will be addressed and resolved very soon.
