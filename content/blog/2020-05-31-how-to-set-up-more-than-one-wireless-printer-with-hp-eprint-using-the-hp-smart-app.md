I spent most of my time the past week trying to set up a second wireless HP printer in my apartment. The process was hell for a variety of reasons.

- ***First*** `Mac compatible Printer` I had `connected` to `HP Smart`: `HP Tango X`

- ***Second*** `Mac compatible Printer` I `connected` to `HP Smart`: `Laser Jet Pro M102w`

***First***, there was the documentation, or rather lack  thereof. ***Second***, it was ***hard*** to get a `live person` to ***speak with*** in `HP support`. Not that support ended up being the complete help I needed! But at ***least*** I learned all the steps ***by heart***!

***Initially***, it took me forever to `connect` to this **second printer** and ***add it*** to the `HP Smart app` to begin with, which ***replaced*** `hpconnected.com`. ***Most*** initial `Google searches` ***pointed*** to the **old website**, which ***no longer exists***. ***Only after*** a week of `searching` and ***trying out*** different `search keywords`, did I finally get some ***partially*** `relevant information` I was ***looking*** for. The ***other*** issue which might have **contributed** to the ***complexity*** of setting up the ***second printer*** is that it was purchased ***for*** us, and **not** ***by*** us. The ***first*** printer was purchased by ***me***.

I thought I would share the information I gathered that resulted in a successful `set-up` of a ***second*** `HP wireless printer`.

***First***, you have to **download** the `HP Smart app` to the ***device*** you want to **connect** your ***printer*** to. I already had ***one*** `HP Smart printer` ***connected*** to my own `iPhone` and `laptop`, and I did ***not*** want (and could not) to **connect** a ***second*** `wireless printer` to those ***same devices***. Even if I could, it would mean a ***much slower*** `connection` for ***both***. As it is, I have ***intermittent*** `wireless congestion` in ***general***, so a ***second*** `wireless printer` to the ***same network*** would have been a **disaster** for ***me***. Especially since the printer was ***not meant*** for **my use** in the ***first place***!

***After*** you have **downloaded** the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-smart/id469284907), make sure that you ***actually*** have **created** an `account` on the [HP Smart](https://www.hpsmart.com/us/en) `website` ***as well***. In order for everything to work ***properly***, **not** ***only*** do you have to `connect` your `printer` to the `HP smart app` on a `mobile device` such as an `iPhone` if you want to ***print*** from a `mobile device` (which you ***should*** want to do, since that is the ***main point*** of `HP Smart` to ***begin with***), but you have to make sure that the `HP Smart website` ***recognizes*** that **printer** as ***well***. This step is ***crucial*** to being able to **set up** an `email address` for the `printer` so that you can ***print*** an `attachment` using the printer's ***unique*** `email address` from your ***own*** `email address`. In ***other words***, you send an `email` to the printer's ***unique*** `email address` with the `file` you want ***printed*** `attached` to the `email`. I will explain this in a bit. It's just ***important*** to **know** ***why*** it is **important** to have an `account` on the `HP Smart website`.

You can ***also*** set up your `wireless printer` for **printing** off of your `desktop/laptop` computer ***as well***. However, I will ***not*** be **covering** that ***aspect*** in this article. 

The ***main purpose*** here is to **discuss** creating a `unique email address` using HP's `Web Services` so that ***trusted parties*** (or you yourself) can **send attachments** to your `printer` that are ***subsequently*** printed out there. This is a `great feature` if you are ***not*** in the same **location** as your ***printer***, but a ***remote*** one, and want to **print** to that ***printer***, and **read** the ***contents*** at a **later date**. Or perhaps ***send it*** to **someone** who is at the `printer location` so that ***they*** can read it.

In ***my*** case, I am able to easily have ***two*** `wireless printers` which can function in ***tandem***,  because I have ***two*** `wireless networks` ***set up***, and can **dedicate** ***one network*** to one `printer`, and the ***other network*** to another `printer`.

I only found out after ***much struggle***, that the ***second*** printer had to be in the ***same room*** as the `network router` in order to be ***able*** to be **set up** and ***work properly***. I have `internet capability` in ***another room*** where I first set up the ***second*** printer, but it was ***impossible*** to `connect` the ***second*** `wireless printer` properly. Things took ***forever***, and the printer oftentimes also `lost connection`. ***Most important*** was that I was ***not able*** to `create` a `unique email address` for the ***printer*** from that `location`.

When I ***finally*** figured out ***where*** to **place** the ***second*** printer, it took ***no time*** to set things up.

It's all about LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION.

***First*** I set things up ***via*** the `HP Smart app` on an ***another*** `iPhone` which was **connected** to a `wireless network` ***different*** from my `iPhone` and `laptop`. Then I had to ***connect*** to `HP Web Services` by **typing** in the `unique IP address` of the `printer` in the `web address bar` on the ***associated*** `iPhone`. This ***took me*** to the `HP Web Services website`.

***Next***, I had to make sure that I was in the `HP Web Services` ***tab***. If ***not***, I would have had to ***click*** on it to ***get in***.

Then I had to ***click*** on an `"Enable Web Services"` **button** ***located*** in the `HP Web Services` **tab**, and was then ***given*** the `prompt` that a `printout` of the **printer** `Info Page` was ***being made***. The page ***contains*** the **printer** `email address`, and the **printer** `claim code`, so that you can ***add*** your `printer` to ***your account*** on the `HP Smart` **website**. It even ***prompts*** you to go to `hpconnected.com` to ***enter*** the **printer** `claim code` within your ***account***, and thereby be able to **manage** your ***printer***. ***However***, when you **type** `hpconnected.com` in the `web browser`, you will be ***re-directed*** to `hpsmart.com`.

***Enabling*** `HP Web Services` ***results*** in your `printer` being `web-connected` and having its ***own*** unique `email address`. The `email address` ***allows you*** to `email` **file attachments** to your ***printer*** and **print** from ***anywhere*** at any time. IF you ***want*** to **print articles** off the `internet`, that is ***touch*** and ***go*** with this **set-up** and can **take** a ***long time***, depending on ***which*** device you `email` ***from*** and how ***far away*** you are **physically** from the ***printer***.

For ***example***, when I **sent** an `email` from my ***laptop*** via my `gmail account`, **containing** an ***attachment*** which I wanted to ***print out***, the `printer` ***received*** the `request` almost ***instantaneously***. However, I ***first*** had to **save** the ***article*** in question on my **desktop** as an `html page` that I ***subsequently*** could **attach** to the ***email***. This was ***not*** optimal, as it involved a couple of ***extra*** steps, and **only text** was ***printed out***. The ***only*** other way I could ***possibly*** send the `article` via ***email***, was by ***copyin*** and ***pasting*** the **contents** of it into the ***body*** of the `email`. And ***who knows*** how it would **print out**! That ***also*** would involve **extra steps** and therefore ***extra time***.

The ***best way*** to **send articles** for ***others*** to `print out`, is by ***texting*** the **link** to the `article` via `smart phone`. ***Then*** the person **receiving** the ***text*** just has to **click** on the ***link***, **then** on the `iPhone` ***share icon***, which **takes them** to ***sharing*** and/or ***printing options***:

![iPhone share icon image](/img/img_3680.png)

***Click*** on the `icon` with the `upward arrow`, and it will ***take you*** to **various options**, ***including*** printing with `HP Smart`, ***located*** towards the **bottom** of the `iPhone` **screen**. ***Click on*** `Print with HP Smart`, and it will ***show*** the `individual pages` of the ***selected*** `web article` (or `document`) to be ***printed***. ***Click*** `Print`, and a `progress bar` will ***appear***, letting you know ***which*** pages are being ***printed***, one at a time.

It is ***very*** quick and easy. No fuss. No muss. I am ***including*** the ***link*** to the `comprehensive documentation` I ***finally*** found `yesterday` on how to ***set up*** an `HP Smart website account` to ***enable*** `HP Web Services` for your `wireless printer`. ***This*** `article` in ***conjunction with*** the `HP Smart documentation` I have ***included*** in the `Related Resources` **section** of this podcast's `transcript/post` on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) should be ***all you need*** to **set up** your ***first*** OR ***second*** `wireless HP printer`.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. Bye for now!
