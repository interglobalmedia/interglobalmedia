As I mentioned in my podcast entitled [Multer, Amazon S3 and AWS Amplify](https://anchor.fm/maria-campbell/episodes/Multer--Amazon-S3-and-AWS-Amplify-e4qqmr), my latest challenge has been to figure out how to delete  images dynamically ***uploaded*** via [multer s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3) to [AWS Simple Storage Service (aka S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

***Done***. 

And that would also be part of the presentation I would be giving at **Code Camp NYC 2019**. I just found out today that tomorrow is the last day in which they will be sorting through submissions to determine which ones will make the cut. Fingers crossed!

If by any chance they do not accept my submission, I will be submitting it to meetups which might be interested in the topic. I am sure there will be at least one out there that would be. Perhaps even the ***Official AWS Meetup NYC***!

Thanks to maintaining focus on my Full Stack JavaScript specialization and sheer determination, I was able to achieve my goal.

The title of my proposed presentation is 

>The Evolution of Full Stack JavaScript Development:
The Benefits of Using Graphql in Full Stack JavaScript Applications
And Why It Makes The Developer Workload and Dynamic Image Management Much Easier

If there is anyone who is interested in this topic for a conference or meetup or interested in learning about it one on one, please contact me at <a href="mailto:interglobalmedia@gmail.com" title="email me">interglobalmedia@gmail.com</a>.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading pleasure***. I will be including the related resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
