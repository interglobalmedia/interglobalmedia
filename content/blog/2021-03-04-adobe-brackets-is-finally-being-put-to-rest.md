Just as I got to know `Adobe Brackets`, I found out 3 days ago, inside my
editor, that it is being **_deprecated_**, and will no longer be maintained. The
team suggested that everyone **switch over** to `VS Code`.

Well, considering they weren’t making any updates to it for at least the last
year or so (or more), that it was **over** `HTTP` and NOT `HTTPS`, and probably
a whole bunch of other things I am not even aware of, I am **_not surprised_**.
They probably didn’t feel like putting in the time because it was open source
and not a money maker, and these days there are other much better alternatives
out there that are also **open source**, but are **well maintained** by
`Microsoft` (for **_example_**).

I did like the `UI/UX` **feel** of the (`Adobe Brackets`) editor, and will miss
that part. The `Atom` code editor is **_similar_** in **feel**, and a great
little editor now **_also maintained_** by `Microsoft`. They **own** `Github`,
and `Github` **_originally created_** `Atom`. Anyone who loved using (`Adobe`)
`Brackets` **_should transition_** to `Atom`. Then, if one starts building
bigger, more complex applications, perhaps even full stack, I **would suggest**
`VS Code`. `Atom` is just a **_nice_** code editor for getting your feet wet,
and to prepare you for code editors like `VS Code`.

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with
a **transcript** in the **_form_** of
a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for
your **_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
