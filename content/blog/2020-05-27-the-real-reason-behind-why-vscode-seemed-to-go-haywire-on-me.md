A couple of weeks ago, when I launched one of my projects with `VS Code`'s `Live Server`, everything seemed so ***small*** and ***unintelligible*** all of a sudden. I couldn't figure out why things were rendering so queerly in the browser. Because I could not figure out the culprit, I ***switched*** over to `WebStorm`.

I do love `WebStorm` for ***some*** things, but I also ***love*** `VS Code` for others. Depending on what I am working on, I ***might*** **prefer** one Code Editor over the other.

But I do love the ***ease*** of **access** and ***use*** of VS Code. Lately I found myself using it just do quick checks, and kept on opening `Live Server` to see whether the situation there had changed. Then by accident, I went into `Chrome`'s `View Tab`, and came across the ***option*** `"Actual Size"`. I ***clicked*** on it, and everything went back to normal. I never remembered changing the view size in `Chrome` or anywhere else, but was glad that I finally was able to resolve the issue. What's ***strange***, however, was that the **problem** ***only*** appeared `locally` when I was using `VS Code` and ***not*** when I subsequently used `WebStorm`. On a ***remote server***, things rendered as expected. Go figure.

So if you use `VS Code` and `Chrome`, and ***suddenly*** everything in the `browser` seems ***very small*** and ***strange***, just **click** on the `View tab` when in `Chrome`, and select the `"Actual Size"` option.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. Bye for now!
