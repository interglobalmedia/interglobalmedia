The other day, one of my students was having ***problems*** **pushing** his **local repository** `source code` to his ***remote*** `Github repository`. He also needed **guidance** in ***organizing*** his `repository content`.I ***worked*** **with him** in ***organizing*** his `repository content` into ***different*** **folders** by doing the following:

- I forked his repository. Yes! Forking was revisited! 

- I git cloned the fork to my laptop. 

- I made the necessary organizational changes to the project content. 

- I made sure to git pull upstream master (the branch in question) for (potential) changes that might have been made by him on remote after my last upstream update without my knowledge.

- I pushed my changes to my forked repository. 

- I created a pull request on his original repository. 

- He merged that pull request.

The `key` to all this is, that we `coordinated` the `pull request`. I ***made sure*** that he did **not push** any more **changes** to ***remote***, because that **might have** ***resulted*** in **merge conflicts**! After he ***merged*** the `pull request`, he could **continue** ***pushing changes*** to **remote** ***without*** **having to worry** that I ***might*** be **making changes** to the **same content** in my ***forked repository***, and then **create** a `pull request`.Road blocks ***organically evolved*** into his **learning more** about a `skill` ***essential*** to any `designer`, `developer`, or ***any other*** `role` in `technology` today. Git. It also ***indirectly*** AND ***directly*** helps one **become** a ***better*** `designer`, `developer`, or **other** `related technology role`. I love it when `evolution` of any sort is ***organic***! It just ***naturally*** **happens**. And that ***comes from*** `collaborative effort` on **both sides** and a ***willingness*** (AND ***eagerness***) to **learn**. Most ***important*** of all, to **get the job done** within a ***certain time frame***!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. Bye for now!
