I just recently revamped the
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com) website
using [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Very pleased. I just recently
revamped my developer blog,
[mariadcampbell.com](https://www.mariadcampbell.com). Very pleased. And then
earlier today, I attended the
[Manhattan Chamber of Commerce](https://www.manhattancc.org/)'s **Monthly
Entrepreneurship Council** at the [Spacious Flagship](https://www.spacious.com/)
at West 53rd Street in NYC where I learned about a (free) podcasting platform
called [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/). I checked it out, and immediately
decided to replace my old **_Spreaker_** account with a new
[anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/) account. It was time for a complete makeover and
approach. Being a big communicator, I felt the need to (re)connect with my
audience, my constituency, and potential clients. They need to hear what I have
to say and where I am coming from. The ecosystem also needs some fresh blood.
Too much talk from the same people over and over and over sharing the same point
of view or bent. In addition, they always seem to be men. Where are the women
truly voicing themselves? Right now, I can only really think of one residing in
Norway! Her name is Benedicte Raae, Twitter handle
[@raae](https://twitter.com/raae) and she hails from **_Oslo, Norway_**. She is
a breath of fresh air to the developer community, and another proponent of
[GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I recommend following her!

That being said, I thought it time to bring in another perspective as well as
welcoming others who might otherwise not join in on the conversation because of
its limited scope.

**Inter-Global Media Network, Inc.** is not here to reinvent the wheel.
**Inter-Global Media Network, Inc.** is not here to replace the "experts". I am
here to plugin the (myriad) holes scattered across the JavaScript developer
ecosystem. I am here to help people make sense of the bigger picture thereby
making their lives easier. I design, develop, and teach experiences to make
people's lives easier in this increasingly turbulent and confusing world.
