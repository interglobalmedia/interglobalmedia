I have always opened my `code editors` from the `Command Line` and from within
the directory I wanted to open in them using a `shell command`. I did it with
`Atom`, I did it with `Sublime`, with `Web Storm`, `PHP Storm`, and now I do it
with `VS Code`. I do pretty much everything in `Command Line`. So when someone
has a problem with `VS Code` and uses the code editor **_outside_** of the
`Command Line`, I have to **_re-learn_** how to use `VS Code` in a "different
way". I have to take myself back to when I was learning how to use a tool, and I
wasn't using the Command Line. It's like **_temporarily_** retraining your mind.
You **can't** think **_instinctively_**. You have to think **_deliberately_**.

Anyhoo, I decided to create a short little `screen recording` in which I show
how to use `VS Code` first with the `Command Line` to open a project in
`VS Code` then using `Live Server`, then **_not_** using the `Command Line`, and
then using `Live Server` after opening a `file` instead of a `folder`.

I will be hosting the `.movs` on YouTube, and embedding them into the transcript
of this podcast.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
