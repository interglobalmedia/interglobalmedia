I have always opened my `code editors` from the `Command Line` and from within the directory I wanted to open in them using a `shell command`. I did it with `Atom`, I did it with `Sublime`, with `Web Storm`, `PHP Storm`, and now I do it with `VS Code`. I do pretty much everything in `Command Line`. So when someone has a  problem with `VS Code` and uses the code editor ***outside*** of the `Command Line`, I have to ***re-learn*** how to use `VS Code` in a "different way". I have to take myself back to when I was learning how to use a tool, and I wasn't using the Command Line. It's like ***temporarily*** retraining your mind. You **can't** think ***instinctively***. You have to think ***deliberately***.

Anyhoo, I decided to create a short little `screen recording` in which I show how to use `VS Code` first with the `Command Line` to open a project in `VS Code` then using `Live Server`, then ***not*** using the `Command Line`, and then using `Live Server` after opening a `file` instead of a `folder`.

I will be hosting the `.movs` on YouTube, and embedding them into the transcript of this podcast.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. I will be including the related resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
