  In this episode, I talk about the importance of being acquainted with the
  tools one depends on every day at work and that if one is NOT acquainted with
  them, the importance of investing time to conquer them and how to conquer
  them.

It's been a couple of months since I made a podcast. In my last one, I announced that I was going to present at Code Camp NYC. However, a couple of days later I got a call for a gig that originally was going to last a couple of months. But then yesterday I found out that it is going to last longer.

**Update December 14, 2019:** My gig ended up extending another month and will end next week.

I have to say that I enjoyed it fully. And I loved the people I worked with. They are so great. Most important of all, I  learned a lot of new things that I never imagined before I would have the opportunity to learn. It's important to always learn something new, and move forward in life. Otherwise you might as well be dead.

One thing I can say. Today the demarcation between technology and non-technology is blurred. You can no longer separate one aspect from the other. Take that as food for thought!

Embracing technology and the tools it has to offer to us to make our lives easier is indeed a beautiful thing. For those of you resisting it, it is worth taking the time to get to know it better in the realm of the tools relevant to what you do. What may seem painful in the beginning due to something called "the learning curve" and time spent learning makes things much easier once that learning curve has been conquered. Trust me, I know it from personal experience.

	1. Do you fear technology in any way?
	2. If so, why?
	3. What tools are commonly used in your line of work that you have not yet learned
           but would like to (or need to) learn but find challenging?
	4. If so, what are the challenges you think you might face? It doesn't have to be 
           technical at all. It might be a challenge related to opportunity (i.e., lack of) 
           or collaboration. They could even be one and the same.

        5. Do you feel that you don't have the time to learn something new? Don't fall into
           that trap. Yes, it takes investment of time to learn new things, but it can be
           done, and a little bit at a time, steadily, every day. The key to learning 
           things is to keep a physical, running notebook. Most very successful people do 
           just that. I remember reading a post Richard Branson shared on Linkedin just 
           about that. Throughout his business career, he has always kept running, physical 
           notebooks of everything he has learned and done throughout his career on a daily 
           basis. This makes you more self sufficient, helps you remember what you have 
           learned or done, and is a great reference for information that you need to use 
           on an ongoing basis.
