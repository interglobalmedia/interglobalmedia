Often I have to take ***screenshots*** either for **support tickets**, issues I open on **Github** ***repositories***, or **technical posts** I write on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/). I always knew how to take them either with a **Chrome** ***extension*** called **Fireshot Capture** or by pressing the `Shift` key + `Command` key + `3` key (or `4` key). The `Shift` key +  `Command` key + `3` key captured the whole computer screen (pain in the ass), and `Shift` key + `Command` key + `4` key only captured a portion (selected). But you had to select and drag the **Capture Selected Portion Box**, and often you would inadvertently lose it because you accidentally deselected it. Or you would end up with a selection larger than the selection you wanted to capture. It made for ***ugly*** screenshots.

Today I was doing some research on **VS Code**, and I ended up digressing into **OSX**. Especially since I had recently ***upgraded*** to **OSX Catalina**, and it had been giving me some problems because of the ***changes*** it produced in the **OSX** ***operating system***.

What I found **makes** the **Fireshot Capture** Chrome extension ***obsolete***. Now you can take screenshots (or recordings) in a clean and quick fashion. All you have to do is **press** the  `Shift` key + `Command` key + `5` key and the **Capture Selected Portion Box** appears above the specific window you are in. Make the adjustments (easily and accurately) to the **Capture Selected Portion Box** that you want, and then ***click*** the **Capture** button. A small thumbnail of the screenshot will first appear which you have to click on to open. Then, if you are satisfied with the screenshot, close out of it and it will save to the desktop by default. And that is it! So awesome.

I know there are a lot of other cool **features** that have been added in **Catalina** and to the past few system updates prior to it, so I am definitely taking time to get re-acquainted with my computer. Knowing what it has to offer is also very important towards software development, both for frontend and back, as well as simplifying your personal life or work life if outside the realm of software development.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. I will be including the related resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
