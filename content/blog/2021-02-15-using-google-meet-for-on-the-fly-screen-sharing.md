***Recently***, I **found** that **using** ***Discord***’s **screen sharing** for ***on-the-fly* screen sharing** was a ***bust***. It ***complicated*** both ***my life*** and the ***lives*** of my **students**. Things took ***much longer*** to **demonstrate**, and I **wasn’t** ***always*** **able** to ***get*** my ***point across***, even if it ***was*** **supported** by ***slide decks***.

So I ***searched*** for ***“absolutely free”*** **screen sharing software** we ***could use*** in ***addition*** to **Blackboard Ultra** (***used*** for **official class sessions** and **office hours**). I ***wanted*** **something simple** to ***use*** that **everyone** would ***learn*** **how** to **use** ***immediately*** and ***would*** be ***readily available*** for **on-the-fly** ***sessions***.

**After** ***much* research**, I ***finally* stumbled upon** ***Google Meet***. ***As long as*** one has a **Gmail *account***, one has ***access*** to this ***nifty*** **little tool**. ***Access*** to it **resides** ***right inside*** the **Gmail** **inbox**. 

**Google Meet** ***started*** as a **video conferencing** ***solution*** for **people** in **organizations** that ***use*** **G Suite**. ***Then***, ***late*** in **April 2020** (at the ***height*** of the ***first*** **COVID-19** ***wave***), **Google** ***announced*** that **Meet** would ***soon be*** **available** to ***use*** to **anyone** with an **email address** and **internet access**. The ***change*** made **Google**'s ***scalable***, ***stable***, and ***secure*** **modern meeting app** ***available*** to ***everyone***.

**Google** has also ***woven* Meet** ***connections*** into ***other*** **apps**, **such as** **Gmail**, **Google Chat**, and **Google Classroom**. 

> These interconnections give people who use Google's tools a wide range of options for collaboration. People may select whichever tool best helps them accomplish a task, then move from typed text to Google Meet when merited — with all the emotion that video can convey.

To ***start*** **video conferencing** In **Chrome** on ***your computer***, ***go to*** [meet.google.com](https://meet.google.com/) and ***sign in*** if ***necessary***. Then ***select*** **Join** or **Start a Meeting**. On a ***mobile device***, ***install*** the **Meet App** on ***either*** **Android** or **iOS**. When you ***want*** to ***meet***, ***open*** the ***app***, ***tap*** **New Meeting** to ***start*** a **session**. You can **then** ***share*** the **meeting info** with the ***people*** you ***want*** to **join**.

There are ***different*** **ways** you can access **Google Meet**.

You can ***access* Google Meet** via **Gmail**.

You can ***access*** **Google Meet** via **Google Classroom**.

You can ***access* Google Meet** via **Google Chat**.

You can ***access*** **Google Meet** via **Google Slides**.

You can ***access*** **Google Meet** via Your **Jamboard device**.

The ***user interface*** is so ***simple***. It is ***so quick*** to **get up** and **running**. And it is ***forever free***. You even can ***change*** your **background**! So if that is the ***only reason*** why you are ***using*** **Zoom** (***other than*** **recording capabilities**, which **Google Meet** has ***as well***, but that is a ***premium*** **feature**), then ***perhaps*** you **should** ***check out*** **Google Meet**. There is even a **White Boarding** ***capability***, among ***other*** **things**. The **screen sharing** is ***great***, and it is ***easy*** to ***transfer*** **screen sharing** ***from*** one person to ***another***.

I will be **embedding** this ***episode*** of **Plugging in The Holes** ***along*** with a **transcript** in the ***form*** of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. Bye for now!
