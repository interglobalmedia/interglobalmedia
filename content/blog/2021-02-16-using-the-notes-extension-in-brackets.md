description: In this episode, I talk about the advantages of using the Brackets
  Notes extension, a nifty little extension which creates notes within an active
  Brackets window of a project folder. And those notes only exist in Brackets!

I ***just*** started **playing around** with the `Notes` ***extension*** in `Brackets`. ***At first*** I didn’t ***quite*** **get** how to ***keep*** a ***note***, but it is **simple** ***really***, and a ***great*** **way** of ***keeping notes*** and ***demonstrating*** **things** while ***conducting*** some sort of **screen sharing** ***session***, be it a **class**, **lecture**, or even ***code-related*** **meeting**.

***First*** you ***click*** on the `Notes` ***extension*** while in an **active** `Brackets` ***window***, and a `Notes` ***dialogue*** appears.

Then ***click*** on `“New Note”`, and then a **preview window** ***appears***.

You can ***start*** **typing** your `note` in `markdown`. `Notes` ***supports*** `Markdown`.

What is ***interesting*** is that the `note` is ***saved*** and will ***re-appear*** when you go ***back*** into the `project folder` at a ***later date***, but there is ***no*** actual file ***anywhere***. It’s a `note` that ***seems*** to `hang out` in the `Brackets` ***stratosphere***.

According to the `Brackets Notes` ***extension*** on `Github`,

> Extension for Brackets that allows the user to easily add and manage notes, with Markdown support.*

I’m not ***quite sure*** exactly ***where*** it is **saving** ***itself***, but it is ***still there*** in the `Brackets` ***project window*** when I ***re-open*** the `project` in `Brackets`. It does ***not*** appear ***anywhere*** when I open the `project` in `VS Code` or ***any other*** `code editor`. So it is ***storing itself*** somewhere ***somehow***. According to the ***extension*** `repository`, it is being ***saved*** to `Web Storage`, but when I am ***using*** `Brackets`, I am ***not*** on the `Internet`. Go ***figure***.

If ***anyone*** does know ***how*** this **extension*** ***works*** `behind the scenes`, I would ***love*** to ***know***!

I ***can’t*** use `Brackets` as a ***standalone*** since it ***doesn’t*** have `Terminal` ***integration***, and I **rely** ***heavily*** on ***that***. ***Especially*** when I ***need*** to be ***working*** on `multiple projects` or `slide decks` at the ***same time***. I use it ***along*** with `VS Code`! ***Sometimes*** I ***even start*** with `VS Code` for `project set up` ***related steps***, keep that `instance` of `VS Code` ***open***, and then ***switch over*** to `Brackets` for the `content creation` ***itself***. I do ***really like*** its `UI/UX`. It just does ***not*** provide me with ***everything*** that I ***need***. ***However***, this ***little extension*** is ***quite*** the `bonus`!

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a **transcript** in the ***form*** of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. Bye for now!
