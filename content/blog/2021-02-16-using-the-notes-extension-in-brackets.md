    In this episode, I talk about the advantages of using the Brackets Notes
    extension, a nifty little extension which creates notes within an active
    Brackets window of a project folder. And those notes only exist in Brackets!

I **_just_** started **playing around** with the `Notes` **_extension_** in
`Brackets`. **_At first_** I didn’t **_quite_** **get** how to **_keep_** a
**_note_**, but it is **simple** **_really_**, and a **_great_** **way** of
**_keeping notes_** and **_demonstrating_** **things** while **_conducting_**
some sort of **screen sharing** **_session_**, be it a **class**, **lecture**,
or even **_code-related_** **meeting**.

**_First_** you **_click_** on the `Notes` **_extension_** while in an
**active** `Brackets` **_window_**, and a `Notes` **_dialogue_** appears.

Then **_click_** on `“New Note”`, and then a **preview window** **_appears_**.

![Notes Preview Window](/img/brackets_notes_preview.png)

You can **_start_** **typing** your `note` in `markdown`. `Notes` **_supports_**
`Markdown`.

What is **_interesting_** is that the `note` is **_saved_** and will
**_re-appear_** when you go **_back_** into the `project folder` at a **_later
date_**, but there is **_no_** actual file **_anywhere_**. It’s a `note` that
**_seems_** to `hang out` in the `Brackets` **_stratosphere_**.

According to the `Brackets Notes` **_extension_** on `Github`,

> Extension for Brackets that allows the user to easily add and manage notes,
> with Markdown support.\*

I’m not **_quite sure_** exactly **_where_** it is **saving** **_itself_**, but
it is **_still there_** in the `Brackets` **_project window_** when I
**_re-open_** the `project` in `Brackets`. It does **_not_** appear
**_anywhere_** when I open the `project` in `VS Code` or **_any other_**
`code editor`. So it is **_storing itself_** somewhere **_somehow_**. According
to the **_extension_** `repository`, it is being **_saved_** to `Web Storage`,
but when I am **_using_** `Brackets`, I am **_not_** on the `Internet`. Go
**_figure_**.

**Update 2.16.21**: The **_best part_** of this **_little_** `Notes`
**_extension_** is that you can **_export_** its **contents** to a `Markdown`
**_file_** with an `.md` (**_for_** `Markdown`) **_extension_**! Just
**_click_** on the `Settings` **_gear icon_** in the `Notes` **_dialogue_**, and
a **_tooltip dropdown_** **appears**. **_Select_** `Extract to file` and
**_click_** on it. A **_new_** **file** called `Unititled-1.md` will
**_appear_** in the `Brackets` **_left sidebar_**. When you **_make_** that
`file` your **_active_** `Brackets` **_window_**, you will **_see_** the `text`
you **_created_** in your `note`! And THAT _WILL_ APPEAR in your
`project folder` and in **_all other_** `code editors`!

If **_anyone_** does know **_how_** this **_extension_** **works**
`behind the scenes`, I would **_love_** to **_know_**!

I **_can’t_** use `Brackets` as a **_standalone_** since it **_doesn’t_** have
`Terminal` **_integration_**, and I **rely** **_heavily_** on **_that_**.
**_Especially_** when I **_need_** to be **_working_** on `multiple projects` or
`slide decks` at the **_same time_**. I use it **_along_** with `VS Code`!
**_Sometimes_** I **_even start_** with `VS Code` for `project set up`
**_related steps_**, keep that `instance` of `VS Code` **_open_**, and then
**_switch over_** to `Brackets` for the `content creation` **_itself_**. I do
**_really like_** its `UI/UX`. It just does **_not_** provide me with
**_everything_** that I **_need_**. **_However_**, this **_little extension_**
is **_quite_** the `bonus`!

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with
a **transcript** in the **_form_** of
a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for
your **_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
