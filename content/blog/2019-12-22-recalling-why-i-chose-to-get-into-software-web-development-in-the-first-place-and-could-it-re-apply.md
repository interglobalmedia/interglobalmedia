Lately I have been re-evaluating my mission and goals. That brought be back to remembering why I chose to learn software/web development in the first place.

It was 2005, and I had been laid off from my second beauty company position. I found it impossible to find another one like it. In fact, it was impossible to find any position of "worth". I went from one low paying temporary job to another for a number of years.

And then tech became cool and the career to pursue. In 2011, the first boot camp, General Assembly appeared. I toyed with the idea, but it cost a fortune which I could NOT afford. So I put that aspiration by the wayside for the time being.

After a couple of more temporary jobs along the way, financial help came my way so that I could go back to school to formally learn how to code.

After two rounds and loads of online courses, I tried to make a go of it. It just did not happen. Once they saw my resume, no one was interested in giving me even 5 seconds of their time. There were a few near successes, but after that, nothing.

I found, however, along that journey, that I was very good at teaching others. Especially those that had problems learning something of a technological nature. I helped them reach solutions more clearly.

I love helping others solve problems. I love a challenge. That's why I loved web development. There was always a challenge to face and solve.

But that aspiration and goal never came to fruition. And one needs to eat in order to live. And one needs money for that!

But one thing I did re-iterate when I first started to formally learn to code (I had taught myself previously and had created a couple of my own websites as a result) - even administrative assistants had to have a certain level of technological understanding for their job. And I subsequently found out that that is SO true.  Oftentimes, it is the admin who knows their way around the software or program and NOT their boss. However, one day that will change too.

I still believe in continuing to pursue the acquisition of technical knowledge. These days, that should not stop for anyone. We are becoming such a Do It Yourself society. I am, however, adjusting my career goal(s). Providing support to high level individuals might be an option. I definitely have that in my background. We'll see where that gets me. Who knows? Perhaps I can make their lives easier. Fingers crossed!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a ***transcript*** in the form of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. I will be including the related resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
