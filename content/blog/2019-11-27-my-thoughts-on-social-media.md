A couple of weeks ago I finally removed myself from Facebook. I didn't like what
they are doing with our data, and honestly, I got bored with the platform
altogether. But the biggest reason was the following:

Many people I knew personally, grew up with, or perhaps had worked with at one
point, who lived in the same area as me only wanted to chat with me there so
that I could help increase their social ranking. But when it came to
socializing, they wanted no part of that â€¦ with me. So why should I continue to
boost their social ranking and in certain cases indirectly pad their wallets,
for lack of a better term, when they don't want anything to do with me in
reality? Don't worry. This phenomenon is not unique to me. When you think of it,
it touches all of us. Just not everyone sits back, thinks about it, and realizes
this. Perhaps that is better for most. Otherwise, it could lead to heartache and
disaster for many.

I use Twitter a lot because it has always been a great source of information for
me. I never considered it a way of connecting with others. Balderdash.

I use Linkedin for potential career opportunities and connections. It has been
more miss than hit, but it still has its use and value. So I continue to forge
ahead there.

I do miss what Facebook used to mean to me years ago. I am yet to find a
replacement. Any suggestions? I would love to hear from you!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on interglobalmedianetwork.com for
your **_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
