***Recently*** **two things** ***happened*** to my `MacBook Pro` (`late`) `2015`: the **battery** ***expanded*** (and **warped** the ***bottom*** **piece** of my **computer**) and ***maybe*** as a **result** of the ***first*** **happening**, the **software** ***related*** to `Spotlight Search` **became** ***corrupt***. It **misread** the `free space` on my **computer** (**basically** that I ***had*** **none** when that **was** SO NOT **the** ***case***).

I ***finally*** **got back** my **computer**. It **took** the `Mac Repair` **shop** ***no*** **time** to **fix** the ***first*** **issue** - they **replaced** the **bottom** (**piece**) of my **computer** where the **battery** was **located**. It **was** the ***second*** **issue** which **took** them **forever** to **fix** (just under two weeks), and there was **virtually** ***no*** **communication** between the **tech** and **myself** ***until*** the **day** I ***actually*** **got back** the **computer**. I **didn’t** even **see** his **whole communication** until ***after*** the **fact**.

The ***point*** is, **when** I **rebuilt** my **computer** `application` **configs** (they **had** to **wipe out** the **software** ***installed*** on my **computer** and **re-install** it), I **found** that I could ***not*** **retrieve** certain **music** on my **laptop** that I had **purchased** in the **iTunes Store** over the (**many**) **years**, but I was **able** to **access** ***all*** that **music** on my **iPhone**. At ***first*** I **couldn’t** figure out **why** that was the **case**, but when I **called** `Apple Care`, after ***some*** **discussion**, we ***both*** **realized** that it was **thanks** to my **yearly subscription** to `iTunes Match` which **saved** ***me*** and my ***music***. `iTunes Match` **keeps track** of what an `Apple Customer` has **purchased** ***no*** **matter what** their `Apple ID`. I **have been** a ***very*** **long time** `Apple user/customer`, and `Apple IDs` have been **ever** ***evolving***. **Honestly**, I have **forgotten** a **couple** of `IDs` ***from*** **years ago** along the way. But **once** I **realized** that **all** I **had** to **do** was **sync** my `iTunes Match` **with** my `MacBook Pro` **device**, everything was fine!

`iTunes Match` ***only*** **costs** `$24.99/year` (one can **store** up to `100,000` **songs**!), and it is **worth** ***every*** **penny**. In the ***long*** **run**, it **saves** **a lot** of **headache**. To **learn more** about `iTunes Match` and **how** it **works** with `iTunes` (***now*** called `Apple Music`), please **visit** the **post** [Subscribe to iTunes Match
](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204146) on the `Apple Support` **web site**.

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a **transcript** in the ***form*** of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your ***hearing*** and ***reading*** pleasure. Bye for now!
